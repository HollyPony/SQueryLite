### Development

#### Compile

You must provide drivers to compile, see next.

For now, open the .pro file in QtCreator with a C++11 compiler and Qt4+ (tested with 5.5). Clic Compile or Run.

#### Drivers

Drivers for each db should be provided. For that ... you should have them.

##### Mongo
 Follow this [steps from officiel wiki](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-cxx-driver/wiki/Download-and-Compile-the-Legacy-Driver).
